# scala.xsl

This builder currently ships with CIMTool.

## Builder Description

The **scala.xsl** builder generates a [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)) source file that defines a vocabulary corresponding to the profile.

Per the wikipedia entry for Scala:

>*Scala is a strong statically typed general-purpose programming language which supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java.</br>Scala source code can be compiled to Java bytecode and run on a Java virtual machine (JVM). Scala can also be compiled to JavaScript to run in a browser, or directly to a native executable. On the JVM Scala provides language interoperability with Java so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a syntax termed curly-brace which is similar to the language C.*

A sample extract of a generated Scala source file is illustrated next:

## Builder NTE Configuration

Given this builder ships with CIMTool the below screenshot highlights the existing NTE (Name/Type/Extension) settings for the builder.  We strongly recommend that you do not import customized versions of this shipped builder over the original in your local CIMTool installation. Doing so will force regeneration of any existing builder-generated artifacts for projects in your workspace that have this builder enabled.

The recommended best practice is to rename the builder file  (from ```sql.xsl``` to ```custom-sql.xsl``` for example) before importing. On import this will be interpreted as a new builder and you will be allowed to enter values in the Type and Extension fields.

>*NOTE: </br>CIMTool requires that file extensions be unique and will prevent you from entering an extension already assigned to a builder. This is because an artifact's name is derived by concatenating the base name of the CIMTool ```.owl``` profile with the file extension assigned to the builder. Therefore, a unique file extension must be assigned to each builder when imported. The file extension for a builder can be modified later from with the "Maintain XSLT Transform Builders" screen.*
