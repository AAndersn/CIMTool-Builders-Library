# xsd.xsl

This builder currently ships with CIMTool.

## Builder Description

The **xsd.xsl** builder generates an XSD schema that is compliant with the [IEC 62361-100:2016 "CIM Profiles to XML Schema Mapping"](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/25114) published standard.  The **IEC 62361-100:2016** standard describes a mapping from CIM profiles to [W3C XML Schemas](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/), intended to facilitate the exchange of information in the form of XML documents whose semantics are defined by the IEC CIM and whose syntax is defined by a W3C XML schema.

Additionally, the XSD schemas generated by this builder will be fully compatible with the [IEC 61968-100:2013 "Implementation Profiles" Ed 1.0](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6198) published standard which provides the implementation profiles for integrating the IEC 61968 Component Interface Standards (i.e. IEC 61968-3 through IEC 61968-9) using common integration technologies, including JMS and web services. This "Part 100" standard also provides guidance with respect to the use of Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) technologies. This provides a means to derive interoperable implementations of IEC 61968-3 to IEC 61968-9. At the same time, Part 100 can be leveraged beyond information exchanges defined by IEC 61968, such as for the integration of market systems or general enterprise integration.

For a builder that generates XSD schemas compatible with [IEC 61968-100 Ed 2.0](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/67766) visit the entry for the [xsd-part100-ed2.xsl](/xsd-part100.ed2/builder.md) builder.
