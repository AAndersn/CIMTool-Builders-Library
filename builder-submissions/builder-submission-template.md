# {NAME OF THE XSLT BUILDER FILE e.g. json-schema-draft-07-jsonschema2pojo.xsl}

A custom builder created on behalf of UCAIug. This is a community provided builder that does not ship with CIMTool.

## Builder Description

{THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF YOUR BUILDER MUST APPEAR HERE.  UTILIZE LINKS TO ALLOW FOR USER NAVIGATION SUCH AS THAT SHOWN IN THE EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION BELOW. NOTE THE USE OF RELATIVE URLS IN THE EXAMPLE WHEN REFERENCING OTHER CONTENT WITHIN THE REPOSITORY. IF YOUR CUSTOM BUILDER IS DERIVED FROM A PRE-EXISTING BUILDER IN THE LIBRARY NOTE THAT ACCORDINGLY.}

The **[json-schema-draft-07-jsonschema2pojo.xsl](json-schema-draft-07-jsonschema2pojo.xsl)** builder produces a specialized JSON schema to be used as input into the [jsonschema2pojo](https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo) open source [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build plugins to generate annotated Java classes (i.e. [POJOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object)) for data-binding with [Jackson 2.x](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) or [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson). This custom builder was derived from the [json-schema-draft-07.xsl](../../shipped-builders/json-schema-draft-07/builder.md) builder and is intended to serve as a companion builder to it.

This builder produces JSON schemas used for generating code to exchange JSON payloads between systems with the latter's schemas used to validate those JSON payloads (typically on the receiving end). The schemas generated by this builder are not guaranteed to be valid JSON schema nor useful for validating instance data, rather they serve only for the purposes of Java code generation using jsonschema2pojo.  

Below is an example of a specialized JSON schema generated by this builder. The jsonschems2pojo ```javaType``` keyword at the root of the schema specifies a fully qualified Java type:

```{type of content: JSON, XML, JAVA, SCALA, PYTHON, etc.}

## Builder NTE Configuration

{LEAVE THE BELOW DESCRIPTION AS IS AND SIMPLY INCLUDE A SCREENSHOT OF YOUR IMPORT SCREEN WITH THE RECOMMENDED NTE SETTINGS FOR THE CUSTOM BUILDER.  THE SCREENSHOT SHOULD BE INCLUDE IN YOUR CUSTOM BUILDER DIRECTORY AND MUST BE ALL LOWER CASE AND NAMED:  import-builder.png}

The below screenshot highlights the NTE (Name/Type/Extension) settings for the builder.

>*NOTE: </br>CIMTool requires that file extensions be unique and will prevent you from entering an extension already assigned to a builder. This is because an artifact's name is derived by concatenating the base name of the CIMTool ```.owl``` profile with the file extension assigned to the builder. Therefore, a unique file extension must be assigned to each builder when imported. The file extension for a builder can be modified later from within the "Maintain XSLT Transform Builders" screen.*
